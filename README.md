# 🛤️ Path of the Backend

> _“Mediocrity is a prison. This is the jailbreak.”_

This repository is a **public record** of one developer’s journey to break free from stagnation and reach **true software mastery** — moving forward to conquer the deeper realms of backend engineering.

It is not just code.  
It is a **training ground**, a **dojo**, and a **personal revolution**.

## 💠 Motivation

For years, I’ve been stuck in a cycle of comfort and repetition — working with outdated codebases, surrounded by mediocrity, and not growing. This repository is my **declaration of war** on that state.

I’m following a structured path, with guidance from my sensei (powered by ChatGPT), to become the backend engineer I know I can be — one of mastery, discipline, and deep understanding.
